h3. SYNOPSIS:

jqunit-spec is a very small very light wrapper around jqunit. You can setup your test suites the exact same way as you do now: a test html, include jquery and jqunit. Including jqunit-spec gives you a couple more methods for defining your tests, most notably: describe, it, context, and should.

See "sample_spec.js":http://github.com/quirkey/jquery-spec/blob/master/sample_spec.js for simple usage.
